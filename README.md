Project work still in progress only UI is implemented...

This application supports clicking pictures of fruits and vegetables and a machine learning tensorflow lite model
to analyze and recognise the fruit or vegetable in the image clicked or selected and lists its name, vitamins, calories and nutritional info in a pop-up screen.
Basically works on computer vision and image processing technology

New UI changes(can see the changes in UI.png file above):

1) The Black left arrow button is now replaced by a White left arrow button to increase visibility and clarity
2) The Black camera button is now replaced by a proper white camera button as seen in any regular mobile phone's camera
3) A new gallery button with proper resolution button
4) A sample pop-up is generated after a photo is clicked or selected which will later be removed and replaced once the tensorflow lite model is integrated into the app
